# DarwinGPT

A minimal self-replicating agent based on GPT-3.5/4.

## Usage

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR-API-KEY]
pip install -r requirements.txt
python darwingpt.py
```

This is a primitive way of doing things. A better approach would be to make a modular agent with a command loop. I.e., provide GPT4 with an interactive shell, add plugin support, and give the agent the capability to add new plugins to itself.
